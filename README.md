This project involves creating and managing the Sakila database, a sample database for MySQL that models a DVD rental store. The implementation includes populating tables with initial data, performing data analysis through SQL queries for row counts, sampling, filtering, and modifying data. The project demonstrates practical skills in database operations, including data insertion, updates, and deletions, alongside query optimization techniques.
